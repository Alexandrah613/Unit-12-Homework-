## Unit-12-Homework-

In this homework I fetched the headlines of articles related to bitcoin and ethereum. I created sentiment scores for both. Bitcoin had the highest postive, mean positive and compound score. In the second part, I used Python and NLTK to tokenize the text for each crypto. I then produced the N grams and found the top ten words for each crypto. I then created a word cloud for each. After, I created a NER for each. Bitcoin seems to have the most positive hype, and ethereum is generally connected to bitcoin when either is considered in media.
